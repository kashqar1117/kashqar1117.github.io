Welcome to my portfolio site!
This site containes three pages; About, Contact, and Portfolio page. All made with HTML5, Bootsrap, CSS, and a small amount of media query.  All pages follow a simuliar style to aid in cleanliness and intuitiveness. Let my give you a quick tour.

Basic layout
(These elemts are on every page of the Website)
With Bootstrap, I picked a simple navagation bar layout that is Responsive. I made one edit to the Navagation bar and took the elements with the three links and pushed them to the right with a position:absolute attribute. This is the  one element where i had to use a media query to help with repsonsiveness. Simply i reset the position of the links. 

* The main content, wrapped in the <main> tag,  is where the content of each page os going to lie. 

* The footer will be stuck to the bottom and have all of my social media links at the bottom.

About Page

Portolio Page
This is where liinks to all of my projects will me held inside the <main> tag. i have 6 responsive cards that hold some text unddrneath them. 

Contact Page
Here, inside the <main> tag, will hold my email, phone number, and name.
